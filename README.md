Counter app with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to keep track of customers in a bakery or restaurant (based on pandemic experiences)


**note(I took the photos of the actual food I made so please do not use my photos for any use)

During my college years, the pandemic happened while I was working in a retail store and we had to use an app to keep track of people coming in and out of the store to make sure it didn't exceed the number of people allowed in the space. This counter app is based on that experience. It also allows you to save a count of the number of people in the store at any time (perhaps you'd like to see how many people are in the store at a certain time, or estimate the max people in the store at a time), along with the option to reset the count to zero (for example, if the store is closing and you are kicking all customers out).

Since I really enjoy baking, along with taking photos of food, this app theme is based off of imagined bakery.

Based off of the Scrimba Counter App with some styling personalizations and customizations:

Design:
- app responsiveness for mobile as well as a soft pastel design

Added functionalities:
- you can now decrease in addition to increase the count (to track people coming in and out of the store)
- reset the saved count as well as not being allowed to save more than a certain amount of counts

Some limitations:
- After saving 10 entries, you are not allowed to save any more counts and will be asked to reset the count number.
- Currently you can not go back and erase a saved entry
